// Static vs Dynamic Typed:
// The major difference between static and dynamic typed languages is when the types of variables are checked.
// Static typed languages (Java, C, C++, C#) are checked during the compile stage, so all types are known before run-time.
// Dynamic languages (JavaScript, PHP, Python, Ruby, Perl) are checked on the fly, during the execution stage.

// Also, after dividing the languages into dynamic and static, they are then divided again into strong and weak typed.
// Weakly typed (JavaScript, PHP, C, C++) languages can make type coercions implicitly
// while strongly typed (Python, Ruby, C#, Java) do not allow conversions between unrelated types.

// TypeScript created by Microsoft which is a superset of JS. TS has its own compiler. Angular uses Typescript.
