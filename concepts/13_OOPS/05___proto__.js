// This prototype property is used in the constructor function.
// Every function has a prototype property and it references to an object used to attach properties that will be inherited by objects further down the prototype chain.
// The last object in the chain is this built in Object.prototype.
// Remember that difference. Object is a function because it has the prototype.
// Now the object prototype is what we call the base object.
// That's the very last piece or the very last object that we can look for properties on before we point to null.

// The entire explanation is shown in IMG3.
