There are 2 basic philosophies when it comes to how you structure your programs, object oriented and functional. 
Each style has its use in programming, it is not one over the other, but merely a preference in style.

In all programs, there are two primary components the data. 
That is the stuff that we keep in our memory and the behaviour, the things that the programs can do, the functions. 
And in order for us to deal with that, to organize things like that, well, we initially had languages, 
let's say like Java like scheme that had different ideas of what we can do. 
And we learn how Java and scheme where the inspiration of JavaScript.

JavaScript was created using Scheme and Java. 
Scheme focused more on Functions and Java focused more on Objects. 
Hence Javascript was created by using the best of both worlds. 
Object oriented programming says that bringing together the data and its behavior in a single location called an object and containing all of that in a box, 
makes it easier to understand how our programs work.

Functional Programming says that data and behavior are distinctly different things and should be kept separate for clarity. 
So perhaps instead of having a one giant box to describe everything, we have multiple boxes.
