Encapsulation - Organizes code into containers that relate to each other and makes it easier to maintain and reuse. We wrap code inside an object relating one another.
i.e., constructor and function declared outside the constructor, inside a class. 

Abstraction - Hides the complexity from the user by doing the method calculations behind the scenes. This helps us with private variables.
i.e., It helps use private and public variables, also the use of "this" makes our job easy in pointing the object to the right Object.

Inheritance - Gives the properties of a class to another class, keeping code DRY and saving on memory space. 
i.e., When we use "extends" it passes on the entire properties to the child so that it can used without so we don't need repeat ourselves. 

Polymorphism - The ability of an object to take on many forms allowing methods to be used differently by different classes.
i.e., using the "new" keyword we can make multiple copies of the object.
